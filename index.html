          <h1>HI, I'M STEPHAN <strong>SALVANT</strong></h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I am a software developer living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
            <p>As someone who's spent the last ten years traveling for work, I'm interested in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Continuing to travel and experience different cultures</li>
                <li>Trying different food and taking photos while doing so</li>
                <li>And the concept of working while abroad</li>                
              </ul>
            <p> Although I've stepped away from web developement for quite some time, I would hope my different experiences will give me a unique perspective, and make me an asset to a development team.

          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>After graduating college with a bachelors in graphic design, I worked as a graphic and web designer for a short period before I joined the military. After four years in the military, I began working as a defense contractor where I was able to pursue my passion for travel.</p> 
          
          <p> After working with the military in a team environment, I'm excited to shift gears and collaborate with other developers in doing what I love most - building/designing websites and software. A lot has changed in the last ten years and it's exciting to see how much the industry has grown.</p>

          <p>I really look forward to </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Re-learning front-end web development</li>
            <li>FInally learning back-end developement</li>
            <li>Working with UX/UI Designers with my background in design</li>
            <li>Application development for mobile devices</li>
          </ul>

          <p> Outside of coding and travel, I really enjoy music, photography, and culinary arts. Although I've started quite late, I'm learning piano, and trying my best to cook some of my favorite dishes from the places I've been.</p>
